# BnB AI Analyzer

Ever notice how Airbnb only shows you a limited set of properties, even when there are hundreds available? BnB AI Analyzer helps you discover all available Airbnb listings in your target area - not just the ones their algorithm chooses to display. By combining comprehensive property data with AI-powered review analysis, it helps you find and evaluate rentals based on what matters most to you.

The tool works in two phases:
1. First, it performs an exhaustive search of all Airbnb properties in your specified geographic area, uncovering listings that might never appear in your top search results
2. Then, it uses AI to analyze hundreds of reviews, extracting insights about key factors like location convenience, comfort, and accuracy of descriptions - helping you make informed decisions based on real guest experiences

Think of it as having a personal Airbnb researcher who can read every review, check every property, and help you find the perfect match for your specific needs.

Key capabilities:
- ü§ñ AI-driven review analysis that distills hundreds of guest experiences into actionable insights
- üìä Real-time price monitoring and historical trends to help you spot the best deals
- üó∫Ô∏è Smart location analysis with public transport overlays and neighborhood amenities
- üè† Detailed property insights focusing on what matters: cleanliness, comfort, and convenience

Whether you're a traveler seeking the perfect stay or a host looking to optimize your listing, BnB AI Analyzer turns overwhelming rental data into clear, actionable intelligence.

- `review_app.py`: Application for reviewing and analyzing listing data
- `overlays/`: Directory containing map overlay CSV files
- `searches/`: Directory containing search configurations
- `config.py`: Configuration management and API key handling

  - Efficient data updating and versioning

## Logging Configuration

The application uses Python's built-in logging module to track and record events that occur during execution. Logging is configured to write to a rotating file handler, which stores log files in the `logs/` directory. This setup helps in monitoring the application's behavior and diagnosing issues efficiently.

### Log Levels
- **INFO**: General information about the application's operation.
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information useful for diagnosing problems.
- **ERROR**: Records error events that might still allow the application to continue running.

### Log Files
Log files are automatically rotated with a maximum size of 200KB and up to 2 backup files. This ensures that disk space usage is managed effectively while retaining important log information.

### Excluding Logs from Version Control
The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude the `logs/` directory, preventing log files from being committed to version control.

For further details, refer to the `logging_config.py` file in the `src` directory.
